      <h1>The clock is ticking — and everyone knows it</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        In a 12-week season with a Week 8 trade deadline, the difference between confidence and denial is measured in days — not games.
      </p>

      <div class="by">
        By <strong>Mark Ellison</strong>, Columnist • Friday Edition
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Nobody likes talking about clocks in Week 5. It feels premature. Unfair. Reactionary.
          But in a 12-week season, pretending time isn’t already shaping decisions is how teams end up explaining themselves instead of controlling their fate.
        </p>

        <p>
          The standings might still be bunched, but don’t confuse proximity with comfort.
          Inside locker rooms across the league, the conversations are already changing.
        </p>

        <div class="pull">
          “We’ve got time” is something teams say right before they don’t.
        </div>

        <h2>The illusion of patience</h2>
        <p>
          On the surface, most teams can justify where they are. A bounce here. A missed look there.
          The process is fine. The effort is there. The room believes.
        </p>

        <p>
          But belief doesn’t bank points — and in a short season, patience isn’t neutral.
          Every week you delay a decision, you narrow the options available when you finally have to make one.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s why Week 5 matters more than anyone wants to admit.
        </p>

        <h2>Quiet tension beats loud panic</h2>
        <p>
          There isn’t chaos in most rooms right now. That comes later.
          What exists instead is something harder to manage: quiet tension.
        </p>

        <p>
          Forwards wondering why the scoring burden keeps falling on the same shoulders.
          Defensemen questioning how many clean games are required to get rewarded.
          Coaches shortening benches without saying why.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one is shouting. No one is throwing sticks.
          But everyone is counting.
        </p>

        <div class="pull">
          <em>
            “At some point, someone has to decide whether this is who we are — or just who we’ve been.”
          </em>
        </div>

        <h2>The Week 8 shadow</h2>
        <p>
          The trade deadline looms larger than the standings right now.
          Not because deals are imminent — but because decisions are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Buyers don’t announce themselves. Neither do sellers.
          What teams do instead is gather evidence. Two more weeks of data. One more look at chemistry.
          One more chance to see if the room responds.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the time the calendar hits Week 7, indecision stops being an option.
        </p>

        <h2>Who this week is really for</h2>
        <p>
          Week 5 isn’t about the teams sitting comfortably at the top.
          It’s about the teams who can still tell themselves a convincing story.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ones saying they’re close.
          The ones pointing to shot totals and zone time.
          The ones insisting that results will follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe they will.
          But in a league this tight, waiting for proof can be just as risky as forcing it.
        </p>

        <div class="pull">
          <em>
            The worst place to be isn’t last. It’s undecided.
          </em>
        </div>

        <h2>The weekend test</h2>
        <p>
          This weekend won’t define seasons.
          But it will define tone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Teams that impose themselves will buy time.
          Teams that drift will feel the calendar press a little harder on Monday morning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone knows the clock is ticking.
          The question is who’s acting like it.
        </p>
