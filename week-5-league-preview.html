      <p class="sub">
        We’re past the quarter mark of a 12-week season. The standings may be tight, but the calendar isn’t — and Week 5 is where “almost” starts costing real ground.

        <strong>Week 5 matchups</strong>
        Owls vs Chanclas • Canes vs Pink Whitney • Fridge Raiders vs Owls
        <div class="muted" style="margin-top:8px;">
          Note: A 12-week regular season compresses the margin for error — points dropped in February don’t come back in March.

        <p>
          At this point in the season, teams don’t need dramatic reinventions. They need habits that hold up when games get uncomfortable.
          Week 5 is built around that theme: discipline versus urgency, pace versus structure, and a few teams who need points badly enough that patience becomes difficult.
        </p>

        <h2>The table, in plain terms</h2>
        <p>
          Chanclas have earned the luxury of calm. The middle of the league is still packed tight enough that one good week can swing positioning.
          For teams near the bottom, the runway is already shorter than it feels — and the calendar doesn’t care how competitive you looked in a loss.
        </p>

        <h2>Owls vs Chanclas</h2>
        <p>
          This is survival versus control. Chanclas have been the league’s north star because they don’t chase games; they wait for opponents to break first.
          Defenseman <strong>Diego Cardenas</strong> continues to quietly dictate pace — clean exits, clean touches, and zero interest in donating odd-man rushes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Owls have shown they can grind games down, stay connected defensively, and keep scores tight. The question is whether they can create enough offense to matter.
          In a short season, “we were right there” becomes a dangerous phrase.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “We’re fine waiting. Most teams aren’t,” said Chanclas defenseman Diego Cardenas.
        </div>

        <h2>Canes vs Pink Whitney</h2>
        <p>
          Process versus firepower — and probably the most stylistically volatile game on the slate. Pink Whitney can turn routine shifts into goals fast,
          led by <strong>Ty “Whiskey” Whittaker</strong> and <strong>Mason Reed</strong>. If they get space, they will use it.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the Canes, the pressure is quieter but real: they’ve been structurally sound, generated pressure, and played long stretches in the right end —
          but in a 12-week sprint, the league eventually demands payoff. If <strong>David Marbles</strong> is pushing pucks coast-to-coast again,
          the Canes will have chances. The question is whether they finish the ones that matter.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “If we let them play fast, it turns into a track meet,” said Pink Whitney center Mason Reed. “We like track meets.”
        </div>

        <h2>Fridge Raiders vs Owls</h2>
        <p>
          This matchup feels like a swing point. The Fridge Raiders remain the league’s volatility kings — dangerous when controlled, chaotic when impatient.
          Forward <strong>Kevin “Kegs” Malloy</strong> brings pace and chaos in equal measure, and the Raiders go as their pace control goes.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the Owls, this is a second pressure spot in the same week: prove you can replicate structure, not just talk about it.
          Repetition is where teams become real.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “If we try to win it in the first ten minutes, we’re probably losing it in the last ten,” said Fridge Raiders winger Kevin “Kegs” Malloy.
        </div>

        <h2>Pressure watch</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Chanclas:</strong> Minimal — that’s the advantage of banking points early.<br>
          <strong>Canes:</strong> The process is sound; the payoff clock is getting louder.<br>
          <strong>Pink Whitney:</strong> Offense travels; structure still has to show up when the game tightens.<br>
          <strong>Fridge Raiders:</strong> Variance becomes risk in a short schedule.<br>
          <strong>Owls:</strong> Competitive nights must turn into points immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>The week’s question</h2>
        <p>
          Who’s comfortable winning ugly — and who still thinks there’s time to wait?
          Week 5 won’t reward the team with the best intentions. It’ll reward the team that stays disciplined after the first momentum swing.
