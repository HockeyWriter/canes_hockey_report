        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Four weeks into a 12-week season, the league is still close enough for excuses to sound reasonable. That’s the danger.
            Because proximity in the standings doesn’t mean proximity in direction. Some teams know exactly who they are.
            Others are still telling themselves stories — about process, about effort, about patience — that won’t survive the calendar.
          </p>

          <div class="pull">
            “It’s early” is something teams say right before it isn’t.
          </div>

          <h2>The Canes: effort isn’t the conversation anymore</h2>
          <p>
            Let’s start with the team everyone agrees “looks fine.” The Canes skate. They forecheck. They generate pressure.
            No one around the league questions their effort. But four weeks in, effort is no longer the differentiator — outcomes are.
          </p>
          <p>
            The imbalance is becoming hard to ignore. A defenseman is leading the internal scoring picture. Forwards are working without reward.
            Leadership messages are still positive, but positivity has a shelf life in a short season.
            At some point, the question shifts from “are we playing the right way?” to “who is actually going to decide games?”
          </p>
          <p>
            That moment is closer than the Canes want to admit.
          </p>

          <h2>Pink Whitney: swagger meets accountability</h2>
          <p>
            Pink Whitney doesn’t lack belief. If anything, belief has never been the problem. They score, they attack, they trust their skill.
            But the league is starting to notice something else too: when games tighten, the same risks keep appearing — and the same explanations follow afterward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Defense wants support. Coaches want restraint. Forwards want freedom.
            You can win games that way. You can even win weeks. But in a 12-week season, unresolved accountability doesn’t stay quiet for long.
            Week 5 isn’t about how many they can score — it’s about whether they can win without needing seven.
          </p>

          <h2>Banditos: when emotion stops being an asset</h2>
          <p>
            There’s a difference between passion and volatility. The Banditos have spent the first month walking that line.
            The effort is there. The emotion is real. But so are the rushed decisions and the moments where structure evaporates under pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the league, there’s growing curiosity — not about the roster, but about the bench.
            Line juggling and shortened hooks can be adjustments. Or they can be symptoms. In a longer season, turbulence can settle.
            In this one, it tends to compound.
          </p>

          <h2>Owls: patience or paralysis</h2>
          <p>
            No team has leaned harder on the phrase “we’re close” than the Owls — and to be fair, they’re not wrong.
            They defend, they stay connected, they grind games down. But structure without scoring eventually turns into frustration,
            especially when you’re asking players to keep believing without giving them relief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management’s patience has been admirable so far. The question is whether it’s also risky.
            At some point, believing in the plan has to be matched with a plan to change the outcome.
          </p>

          <h2>Chanclas: the uncomfortable mirror</h2>
          <p>
            While everyone else debates identity, the Chanclas just keep collecting points.
            They don’t dominate loudly. They don’t chase highlight moments. They don’t apologize for winning games other teams call boring.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that’s what makes them uncomfortable — because they aren’t just winning games.
            They’re forcing the rest of the league to confront itself.
          </p>

          <div class="pull">
            <em>The worst place to be isn’t last. It’s undecided.</em>
          </div>

          <h2>The Week 8 reality</h2>
          <p>
            The trade deadline is looming at Week 8. Not because deals are imminent — but because decisions are.
            Not trades. Not call-ups. Belief decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who still thinks this group can do it? Who knows something has to change? And who’s waiting one week too long to admit it?
            In a league this tight, the teams that act late don’t just lose ground — they lose options.
          </p>

          <p>
            Week 5 won’t decide the season. But it will reveal who’s acting like this season is short — because it is.
