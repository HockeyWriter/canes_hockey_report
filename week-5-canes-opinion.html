        <h1>The forwards can’t keep hiding behind structure</h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          Five weeks in, effort isn’t the debate. The problem is decisiveness — and the longer the Canes wait for offense to arrive, the more it becomes a choice.
        </p>

            The Canes are structured and competitive — but the offense remains concentrated, conservative, and late to arrive.

          <div>Week 5</div>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Five weeks is not a small sample anymore. If this were two weeks, you’d call it variance. If it were three, you’d call it adjustment.
            At five? It’s identity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Canes are not disorganized. They are not soft. They are not getting run out of buildings. They’re losing on thin margins while
            insisting the process will eventually solve a problem that is becoming increasingly obvious: the forwards are not driving enough of the offense.
          </p>

          <div class="pull">
            “If your best offense is coming from the blue line, that’s either a feature — or a warning.”
          </div>

          <h2>The defense is deciding games</h2>
          <p>
            David Marples initiates exits, transports pucks, and creates close-range looks off his skating. Ken Lee shoots through traffic and creates rebounds.
            Garrett Ure turns exits into controlled entries more often than not. The back end is not begging for help — it is providing it.
          </p>

          <p>
            That’s the uncomfortable truth: the Canes’ best offensive sequences are often started — and sometimes finished — by defensemen.
            Which brings us to the part nobody wants to say out loud.
          </p>

          <h2>The forwards are playing cautious hockey</h2>
          <p>
            Andrew Sands is doing what a first-line center is supposed to do: generating shots from dangerous areas, simplifying under pressure, elevating late.
            Ryan Kowal creates chaos and rebounds through volume. But too much of the forward group plays like their first priority is avoiding the mistake, not forcing the defense backward.
          </p>

          <p>
            The neutral zone has become a place where the Canes try not to lose the puck rather than try to win it. Chips without support. Late passes into closed lanes.
            Entries that die before they become pressure. That isn’t lack of effort — it’s lack of conviction.
          </p>

          <h2>The six-man unit tells the truth</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to know who a staff trusts, don’t listen to quotes. Watch who hits the ice when the goalie is pulled.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the biggest moments, the Canes lean on the same core: Sands, Alvarado, Ken Lee, Marples, Pucci — sometimes Chad.
            The forwards sitting down the bench are telling too: Kowal, Jackson Brown, Eugene Oh.
          </p>

          <p>
            That isn’t personal. It’s a scoreboard decision. But it also reveals the real issue: if certain forwards aren’t trusted in high-leverage minutes,
            the problem isn’t depth — it’s production.
          </p>

          <h2>And yes, this comes back to the bench</h2>
          <p>
            This is not a call for firings. It’s a call for evolution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Matt Callahan deserves credit for structure. His teams stay connected. They don’t cheat defense. They don’t implode.
            But structure without adjustment becomes rigidity, and five weeks is enough time to ask why the response hasn’t been more aggressive.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the forwards aren’t producing, why hasn’t a more offense-heavy defenseman been tested at wing in high-leverage moments?
            If the young forwards are risk-avoidant, why not force the issue with deployment? If the offense keeps arriving only when urgency is mandatory,
            why not manufacture urgency earlier?
          </p>

          <div class="pull">
            <em>In a 12-week season, waiting isn’t neutral. It’s expensive.</em>
          </div>

          <h2>The bottom line</h2>
          <p>
            The Canes can keep telling themselves they’re close. The standings are tight enough that they might be right.
            But the league has already started sorting teams on goal differential and total goals — and neither tiebreaker rewards caution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Five weeks in, it’s time to stop asking whether the Canes are playing hard enough and start asking the harder question:
            are the forwards willing to decide games — or seen content to survive them until the third?
