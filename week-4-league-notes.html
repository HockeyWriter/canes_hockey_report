        Three games, three very different scripts — and one consistent lesson: teams that stayed patient got paid.

    Week 4 was defined by narrow margins, structured play, and games decided by patience rather than volume.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Week 4 didn’t reshape the standings dramatically, but it clarified something important: the league is splitting less by talent
          and more by tolerance for chaos. The teams that managed games walked away with points. The teams that didn’t were left
          wondering how a winnable night slipped away.
        </p>

        <h2>Week 4 results</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Chanclas 2, Banditos 0</strong><br>
          <strong>Owls 1, Canes 0</strong><br>
          <strong>Pink Whitney 7, Fridge Raiders 5</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Chanclas vs Banditos: The standard holds</h2>
        <p>
          The Chanclas did what they’ve done all season: took a game that could’ve gotten loose and refused to let it.
          A 2–0 win over the Banditos wasn’t flashy, but it was authoritative. No extended scrambling. No momentum swings.
          Just structure, discipline, and patience.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “They wait you out,” said Banditos winger Ricky “Ruckus” Ramirez. “You try to do too much and suddenly you’re chasing.”
        </div>

        <p>
          For the Banditos, it was another reminder that effort alone doesn’t solve problems. Until they can slow games down,
          they’ll continue to live on the wrong side of these nights.
        </p>

        <h2>Owls vs Canes: One bounce, one result</h2>
        <p>
          The Owls’ 1–0 win over the Canes fit both teams’ early-season profiles perfectly. Low event. Few clean looks.
          One early bounce — and then a game closed out by goaltending.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Canes controlled large stretches of play and generated pressure, but the Owls were comfortable living in a narrow game.
          For the Owls, it was proof that staying connected defensively can still pay dividends.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “We weren’t trying to win it 5–4,” said Owls captain Graham O’Neill. “We just needed one.”
        </div>

        <h2>Pink Whitney vs Fridge Raiders: Chaos reigns</h2>
        <p>
          If you were looking for order, this wasn’t the game. Pink Whitney’s 7–5 win over the Fridge Raiders was the
          highest-event matchup of the week — a reminder that when neither team wants to slow down, the scoreboard
          usually reflects it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pink Whitney’s offensive talent remains undeniable, but the same questions persist for both sides:
          what happens when the game tightens?
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “That’s on us,” said Fridge Raiders forward Kevin “Kegs” Malloy. “We know better than to trade chances all night.”
        </div>

        <h2>Week 4 power rankings (editorial)</h2>

        <div class="rank">
          <strong>1. Chanclas</strong>
          <div class="muted">The league’s north star. Structured, calm, and comfortable winning ugly.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="rank">
          <strong>2. Canes</strong>
          <div class="muted">The process is strong. The margin for error is thin. Finishing remains the separator.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="rank">
          <strong>3. Pink Whitney</strong>
          <div class="muted">Offense travels. Structure still doesn’t — but seven goals fix a lot of moods.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="rank">
          <strong>4. Fridge Raiders</strong>
          <div class="muted">High ceiling, low floor. Until pace control improves, volatility stays.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="rank">
          <strong>5. Owls</strong>
          <div class="muted">Proof of concept defensively. Now comes the harder part: repeating it.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="rank">
          <strong>6. Banditos</strong>
          <div class="muted">Effort is there. Discipline and patience still lag.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
        <p>
          Week 4 reinforced a simple truth: no one is running away with this league. But patience is starting to separate
          teams who can survive the grind from teams who keep trying to shortcut it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Week 5 won’t crown a contender — but it will punish anyone still hoping chaos breaks their way.
